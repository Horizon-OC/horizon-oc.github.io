# Safety Disclaimer
::: info ** Overclocking is inherently risky as it pushes the system beyond its original design. The risk level depends on how much you overclock and whether you stay within the limits of the chip and hardware.**

::: danger **Unstable RAM overclocking can cause sysNAND/emuNAND corruption and SD card corruption, particularly if done on sysNAND. Test the overclock settings on emuNAND and back up your sysNAND, emuNAND and PRODINFO before installing Horizon-OC.**

---

# Mariko Limits

### Mariko PMIC Limits
- Mariko uses a **5A CPU / 10A GPU PMIC** for power delivery.  
- Staying within these limits is essential for safe operation.  
  - Exceeding the **PMIC limit** slightly is possible, but not recommended and should be done with caution.

Reducing the voltage (**undervolting, UV**) decreases power draw, current, heat and helps avoid exceeding pmic limit.

### Charger IC Limit:
- 18W limit restricts overclocking for both Erista and Mariko units (12W on Switch Lite). This is the main limiting factor, but the PMIC current limits for CPU and GPU will be reached first.
- Setting a Charge Current Override will NOT bypass this limit.

### GPU Scheduling

This setting adjusts how much of your GPU can be utilized:

- **On:** Limits GPU usage to ~96.7%
- **Off:** Limits GPU usage to ~99.7% (up to ~5% performance boost)
- **Recommended:** GPU scheduling **off**.
::: danger  ** Warning:** Disabling GPU Scheduling will slightly increase power draw. Use it with caution.

---

# Monitoring Your Switch
- Use the Horizon OC Monitor to indicate if you've bypassed the charger IC limit (e.g., -1W displayed while charging).
- To get the best results, be sure your battery is 10-90% to display the real charging.

---

# Checking Speedo and RAM Type

1. Boot Hekate.
2. Go to Console Info > HW & Fuses.
3. Note your DRAM ID, along with your CPU, GPU and SoC Speedo.
   - Speedos typically range from 1450 to 1810. A higher speedo means less voltage is needed for the same clock speed. A speedo of 1650 is generally considered good.

**Speedo Brackets**
>  - Speedos are divided into **brackets**.  
>  - **CPU UV mode** depends on the position within your bracket, but the resulting **voltage** depends on your specific speedo.
>  - It doesn’t matter how high you can set CPU UV mode — what matters is using your **maximum possible** CPU UV mode.

# OC Settings for Horizon-OC
## General settings

- **Uncapped Clocks:**
  - Removes the clock cappings. Use with caution, especially on handheld mode. Recommended: ON

- **Thermal Throttle:**
  - Lowers clocks when a certain temperature threshold is reached (by default the limit is 70C). Recommended: ON

- **Handheld TDP:**
  - Lowers clocks when the power being pulled from the battery exceeds a threshold (by default 9600mW on regular consoles, 6400mW on lite). Recommended: OFF

- **Overwrite Boost Mode:**
  - Allows boost mode to be overwritten with a custom profile. Recommended: OFF

- **Display Refresh Rate Changing:**
  - Allows changing the display refresh rate via profiles. Recommended: ON (This conflicts with FPSLocker's display refresh rate features, if you intend to use those, keep it OFF)

- **Allow Display Unsafe Frequencies:**
  - Allows changing the display refresh rate to unsafe frequencies. Recommended: OFF

## CPU Settings

- **Boost Clock**
  - 2601 MHz
 > **Note** Exceeding the PMIC Limit in boost mode is *usually* fine as it is only active for short periods of time.

- **UV Table:** 1683Mhz Tbreak
  - If you cannot even do **High Freq UV1**, try **1581Mhz Tbreak**.
    -  Tbreak describes the frequency where the low and high UV modes split.
  - Extreme UV table may provide lower voltages on some units but may cause issues, testing is advised.

- **Low Undervolt Mode:** 1-8 (start with 4).
  - Increase gradually if stable and find your highest stable value.
  - If the console fails to boot, lower the value.
  - Some consoles may not boot even with low UV 1.
    - This isn't much of a problem, because high UV is more important.

- **High UV:** 5-12 (find your highest stable value).

- **CPU Max Clock:**
  - Sets the maximum allowed clockspeed.

- **Low Freq Vmin:** 590 mV
  - In case you experience issues with low Freq UV, try raising Low Freq Vmin to 610-620mV.
  - Going below 590mV is not recommended as it may mess up the CPU table.

- **High Freq Vmin:** 720–750 mV, 850-870 may be required for high RAM clocks

- **Voltage Limit:**
  - **1120 mV:** Safe - recommended
  - **1160-1180 mV:** Use with caution

## GPU Settings

- **Undervolt Table:** HiOPT Table

- **GPU DVFS:**
  - When RAM is overclocked, the minimum GPU voltage requirement is raised.
  - **DVFS** automatically adjusts your vmin based on your ram clock.
  - When using the base ram clocks (1600 MHz), **GPU DVFS** is not active.

 - **GPU DVFS Offset:** 0

- **Vmin:** Auto

- **Vmax:** 800 mV

- **Voltage Offset:** 0

## RAM Settings

- **HP Mode** ON
 > **ℹ️ Tip:** HP Mode improves latency by disabling power down.
 > Lower latency significantly improves 1% lows and reduces stuttering.
 > While rare, some RAM modules may not handle it well.
 > First, find your max RAM clocks and timings with **HP Mode** disabled.
 > Then test with enabled **HP Mode**. If stable, use it - otherwise disable it.

- **DVB Shift:** 1–10
  - Boosts SoC voltage to help stabilize RAM, especially at high frequencies (2400 MHz+ and 3000Mhz+).
  - It's advised to start of with a DVB shift of 10 and only lower it to 2-6 after finding your max RAM speed.
   - Higher DVB shift does not measurably increase power draw, but it is going to increase heat slightly.

 - **Base Latency: (tRWL)**
   - Read Latency: **2133**
   - Write Latency: **2133**
     - A higher base latency allows for a higher frequency at a small latency cost.
     - Find your maximum frequency using **2133** base latency.
     - You may tighten base latency once you find your __maximum__ frequency and tightest timings.
        - Tightening base latency is **only** worth it if you can maintain the same ram frequency.
        - **Write latency** can usually be tightened further than **read latency**.
        - Increasing VDD2 can help tighten latency, but it **never** helps increase maximum frequency.

::: danger It's recommended to find your maximum ram frequency before adjusting timings. This makes it easier to pinpoint common failure points.
``t7`` and ``t6`` are very frequency dependent and likely need to be loosened at higher ram clocks.

::: note 1333tRWL achieves better performance but tops out at a lower frequency (often 300-500MHz less compared to 1600tRWL), recommended to test for handheld.

::: note 2533MHz is known to cause issues due to timing changes, and thus may need looser timings compared to other frequencies. Test with caution.

::: note If your RAM clock goes significantly lower than the target, you may be experiencing a "PLL drop" (where the memory controller is unable to handle the high ram frequency). These drops become more frequent at high SoC temperatures, so monitor your RAM clock carefully! The only way to avoid such PLL drops other than keeping your SoC's temperature low is to get a Switch with a higher SoC Speedo, as a higher SoC speedo generally means the PLL can handle more frequency. This phenomenon generally occurs when pushing your RAM above 3000MHz.

# RAM Tuning Notes

> **💡 Extra Headroom:** For tighter timings or base latency reduction, you may use slight overvoltage. Note that too much overvoltage can cause instability.
> **1212** mV, while being beyond the ram module rating, still falls into the Nvidia pad rating (1212 mV).
> There is no documented damage, but use at your own risk.

> **🧪 Testing Method:**
> 1. Start by setting **DVB = 10** using the common preset.
> 2. Test **ST (Super Tight) timings**.
> 3. If ST fails, relax timings one by one in this order: `t8 → t1 → t2 → t3 → t6 → t7 → t4 → t5`.
> 4. For pushing beyond ST, apply the same incremental approach.
> 5. Lower **DVB**
> **⚡ Performance:** ST timings provide enhanced performance over common timings.

> **⚠️ Stability Notes:**
> - Lower **T7**, **T6** if you encounter issues.
> - RAM contributes the most to overall performance - prioritize finding your maximum frequency first.
> - Rarely, some modules may fail even with common timings. If so, lower timings until stable.

## Display Underclocking
- Display Underclocking helps keep framepacing, which makes lower framerates look smoother.
- Ideally, your display refresh rate should be set to your target framerate, or a exact multiple of it in docked mode (45FPS->90Hz, as most TVs don't support refresh rates that aren't multiples of 10).
---

# Troubleshooting

**My Switch won't boot after I have installed Horizon-OC:**

- Your Atmosphere version is likely not up-to-date, update your Atmosphere version.
- CPU UV level is too high, lower it or set it to 0.

**My configs are not being applied:**
- Ensure you reboot your console after changing settings in Horizon-OC.
- Ensure you click the "Save KIP Settings" button on Horizon-OC.

**I can't set my clocks above 1785/921/1600:**
- Your kip is not being loaded, check if it is located in `/atmosphere/kips`
- Your hekate_ipl.ini file is not set up correctly:
   - Validate that your boot entry contains `kip1=atmosphere/kips/hoc.kip`
   - It has to be below `pkg3=atmosphere/package3` (or fss0)
